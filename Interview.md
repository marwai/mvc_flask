# Interview Preparation

Topics to cover:
- 3 amigos 
- Persona 
- Information Radiators with example 
- Scrum artefacts, scrum events, scrum roles, sprint review and sprint retrospective
- Starfish retrospective, Root cause Analysis-part of retrospective
- Agile vales and principles

There are many more things in agile and scrum for which resources have been provided and you have done it practically 
like user story, epic etc. Have a solid answer ready for what is Agile?
---
###  3 amigos 

- **```Business```** – What problem are we trying to solve?
- **```Development```** – How might we build a solution to solve that problem?     
- **```test```** - What about this, what could possibly happen?
 What about this, what could possibly happen?
 
```The concept of three amigos intends to balance between no collaboration between people with different perspectives and 
involving an entire team in discussing all the details of every increment of work.
```
## Agile Persona 
```
When the project calls for it – for instance when user experience is a major factor in project outcomes – the team 
crafts detailed, synthetic biographies of fictitious users of the future product: these are called “Personas”.

 Knowing that the product will be used by “Eileen, 72, retired”, a developer will weigh more accurately the consequences
 of filling up a modal dialog with 50 tiny dials and settings, which would not necessarily be the case if they thought 
 in terms of “the user”.
  
```
 ## Information Radiators with Example
 An information radiator is a large display of critical team information that is continuously updated and located in a
 spot where the team can see it constantly. The term “information radiator” was introduced extensively with a solid 
 theoretical framework in Agile Software Development. Generic term for any of a number of handwritten, drawn, printed 
 or electronic displays which a team places in a highly visible location, so that all team members
 can see the latest information at a glance: count of automated tests, velocity, incident reports, continuous 
 integration status, and so on.
 
 ## Scrum artefacts 

- Product vision 
- Sprint goal (end product) 
- Product backlog 
- Sprint backlog 
- Definition of done 
- Burn down chart 

## Scrum roles 
- Product owner 
- Scrum master 
- Scrum development team 

## Scrum events 
- Backlog planning 
- Sprint planning 
- Sprint 
- Daily stand up 
- Sprint review 
- Sprint retrospective 

## scrum artfacts
product backlog 
sprint backlog 
increment 

## Sprint review  
- Reviews sprint review weekly, looks back at work done with product owner 

## Sprint retrospective 
- Reviews sprint based on dev team and scrum master in terms of work methods, potential improvements etc.  

## Starfish Retrospective
- Keep Doing – These are things that energize the team, is adding value and something the team is doing well and you recognize the value on it. What are the good things in your project or what will people miss if it isn’t there?
- Less Of – These are practices that are already being done but might need refining because it is not currently helpful or productive in the current situation. This could be as simple as a behaviour, an activity or a routine that is not efficient or value adding in its current form.
- More Of – These might be practices, technologies or activities that team members think there should be more of or is not currently being taken full advantage of. This might be additional paired programming or running more short sharp meetings.
- Stop Doing – These are things that are not bringing value, or even worse, getting in the way.  It’s time for these to go.
- Start Doing – a new idea, or  something you have seen working before that you would like to

## Root cause analysis  
- Ask why five times 
- Gets to route cause of problem 
- Fixes route cause, possibly involving talking to the larger firm 

## Short summary of what is agile 
Agile is a methodology that takes iterative approach towards the completion of the project



scrum helps tracking of backlog, using trello
whereas agile 

## Agile values 
invididual interatction
software 
collobartion 
change 
## Agile Principles 


1.  __Customer satisfaction through early and continuous software delivery__
Customers are happier when they receive working software at regular intervals, rather than waiting extended periods of time between releases.

2.	__Accommodate changing requirements throughout the development process__  – The ability to avoid delays when a requirement or feature request changes.

3.	__Frequent delivery of working software__ – Scrum accommodates this principle since the team operates in software sprints or iterations that ensure regular delivery of working software.

4.	__Collaboration between the business stakeholders and developers throughout the project__ – Better decisions are made when the business and technical team are aligned.


5.	__Support, trust, and motivate the people involved__ – Motivated teams are more likely to deliver their best work than unhappy teams.

6.	__Enable face-to-face interactions__ – Communication is more successful when development teams are co-located.


7.	__Working software is the primary measure of progress__ – Delivering functional software to the customer is the ultimate factor that measures progress.

8.	__Agile processes to support a consistent development pace__ – Teams establish a repeatable and maintainable speed at which they can deliver working software, and they repeat it with each release.


9.	__Attention to technical detail and design enhances agility__ – The right skills and good design ensures the team can maintain the pace, constantly improve the product, and sustain change.

10.	__Simplicity__ – Develop just enough to get the job done for right now.


11.	__Self-organizing teams encourage great architectures, requirements, and designs__ – Skilled and motivated team members who have decision-making power, take ownership, communicate regularly with other team members, and share ideas that deliver quality products.

12.	__Regular reflections on how to become more effective__ – Self-improvement, process improvement, advancing skills, 
and techniques help team members work more efficiently.


## Devops
- used to monolith architecture, database, python controller and front end in one file. As oppose to to independently working 
with framework individually 
- Devops contribute to 
- Devops is a culture in any business environment. To work in an agile environment, devops is required. to help speed up delivery 
of software, help speed on both ends, work as bridge between development and operations, translate the technical information 
and communicate with clients using pipeline and cloud .
